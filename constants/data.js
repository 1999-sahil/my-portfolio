    description1: `Hello! I am Sahil Ahmed, a front-end developer/React developer from India. As a developer, 
        I am deeply interested in both design and coding, and I enjoy using React.js or Next.js to build web 
        application interfaces and functionality. I am a fresh graduate with Bachelor's degree in 
        Electronics and Electrical Enigineering.`,
    description2: `My interest in computers started at a very young age, and I was very eager to learn 
        as much as I could about them. I remember my first website that I made years ago, which had a 
        terrible interface and design. The purpose of it was to download movies and stuff like that. 
        It is unfortunate that I don't have the code.`,
    description3: `After this, I became more and more interested in web development and began to find 
        resources to learn more about it. I watched many video tutorials, read through documentation and articles. 
        The first programming language I learned was C, and from there, I also learned Java and C++. In addition
        to working with programming languages, I have also experimented with databases and have found that MongoDB 
        is my favorite so far. I have also used MySQL and Firebase few time.`,
    description4: `You can do anything you can think of with these three things. Next.js is an open-source web 
        development framework built on top of Node.js enabling React-based web applications functionalities such
        as server-side rendering and generating static websites.`,
